DESCRIPTION
-----------
Synthetic events are dynamic events that are created by matching
two other events which triggers a synthetic event. One event is the starting
event which some field is recorded, and when the second event is executed,
if it has a field (or fields) that matches the starting event's field (or fields)
then it will trigger the synthetic event. The field values other than the matching
fields may be passed from the starting event to the end event to perform calculations
on, or to simply pass as a parameter to the synthetic event.

One common use case is to set "sched_waking" as the starting event. This event is
triggered when a process is awoken. Then set "sched_switch" as the ending event.
This event is triggered when a new task is scheduled on the CPU. By setting
the "common_pid" of both events as the matching fields, the time between the
two events is considered the wake up latency of that process. Use *TRACEFS_TIMESTAMP*
as a field for both events to calculate the delta in nanoseconds, or use
*TRACEFS_TIMESTAMP_USECS" as the compare fields for both events to calculate the
delta in microseconds. This is used as the example below.

*tracefs_synth_create*() creates the synthetic event in the system in the system
in the _instance_ provided. Note, synthetic events apply across all instances,
but some creation requires histograms to be established, which are local to
instances.

*tracefs_synth_destroy*() destroys the synthetic event. It will attempt to stop
the running of it in the given _instance_, but if its running in another instance
this may fail as busy.

*tracefs_synth_show*() acts like *tracefs_synth_create*(), but instead of creating
the synthetic event in the given _instance_, it will write the echo commands to
manually create it in the _seq_ given.

*tracefs_synth_complete*() returns true if the synthetic event _synth_ has both
a starting and ending event.

*tracefs_synth_get_start_hist*() returns a struct tracefs_hist descriptor describing
the histogram used to create the synthetic event.

enum tracefs_synth_handler {
	TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_MATCH,
	TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_MAX,
	TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_CHANGE,
};

*tracefs_synth_trace*() Instead of doing just a trace on matching of the start and
end events, do the _type_ handler where *TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_MAX* will do a trace
when the given variable _var_ hits a new max for the matching keys. Or
*TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_CHANGE* for when the _var_ changes. _var_ must be one of
the _name_ elements used in *tracefs_synth_add_end_field*(3).

RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns zero on success or -1 on error.

ERRORS
------
The following errors are for all the above calls:

*EPERM* Not run as root user when required.

*EINVAL* Either a parameter is not valid (NULL when it should not be)
  or a field that is not compatible for calculations.

*ENODEV* An event or one of its fields is not found.

*EBADE* The fields of the start and end events are not compatible for
  either matching or comparing.

*ENOMEM* not enough memory is available.

And more errors may have happened from the system calls to the system.

	 * Note, the above only added: "next_prio < 50 || !(prev_prio >= 100"
	 * That's because, when the synth is executed, the remaining close parenthesis
	 * will be added. That is, the string will end up being:
	 * "next_prio < 50 || !(prev_prio >= 100)" when one of tracefs_sync_create()
	 * or tracefs_sync_show() is run.
